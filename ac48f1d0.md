# Private Beta instructions

After you sign up for a paid plan [by sponsoring neuron](https://github.com/sponsors/srid)[^wait], use these steps to access Cervea Beta:

[^wait]: Please allow up to 24 hours for your plan to get activated after sponsorship, as this is something I have to do manually for now.

1. Go to the dashboard at <https://www.cerveau.app/>
   1. Scroll to the bottom, and click "Login with GitHub"
   1. You should see a list of repositories you've installed Cerveau on (this list is initially empty)
1. Go to <https://github.com/apps/cerveau-neuron> and "install" it to your repository (if you do not already have one, create one from [neuron-template](https://github.com/srid/neuron-template))
1. This will redirect you back to the dashboard (showing the new list of repositories)
1. Select the repository from the dashboard list
1. If this is your first time, Cerveau will ask you to sync your repo. Click the "sync" icon.
1. Go to a note, and click the "edit" icon; modify and then "save" it.
1. Enjoy the ride!
