# Private Beta instructions

After your GitHub $user and $repository gets whitelisted in beta, use these steps to access Cervea Beta for your $repository:

1. Go to <https://github.com/apps/cerveau-beta> and "install" it to your $repository
1. Go to[^dashboard] `https://beta.cerveau.app/github.com/$user/$repository/master`
   1. For example, if your repository is at <http://github.com/srid/neuron-template>, the Cerveau URL for it is: `https://beta.cerveau.app/github.com/srid/neuron-template/master`
   1. You might want to bookmark this URL during the beta period.
1. If this is your first time, Cerveau will ask you to sync your repo. Click the "sync" icon.


[^dashboard]: Eventually there will be a "dashboard" page, so you don't have to manually do this.
