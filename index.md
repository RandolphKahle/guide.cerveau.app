# Cerveau Guide

## Features

### Sync with Git
Cerveau uses GitHub to store your Neuron notes. View and edit notes directly from your Git repo.

### Markdown editor
Edit Markdown with live preview. Link to notes by search. Optional Vim keybindings.

### Neuron + more
All neuron's feature are supported: z-index, queries, themes, etc. Cerveau is built on top of the open source neuron, and thereby will remain compatible with the later. Your neuron notes automatically work with Cerveau, and vice versa.

### Seamless Publishing
Publish your notes automatically on every change. 

Status: 
- for public repositories, using [neuron-template](https://github.com/srid/neuron-template).
- publishing for private repositories is in roadmap

### Collaborative editing
Collaborate on community zettelkastens, via tight integration with GitHub Pull Requests.

Status: to be done.
