# Cerveau Guide

:::{.ui .purple .large .segment .message}
[Cerveau](https://www.cerveau.app/) enables you to view and edit your [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/) Zettelkasten notes online. By using neuron, your notes are guaranteed to remain [future-proof](https://neuron.zettel.page/6f0f0bcc.html). As Cerveau seamlessly works with GitHub, your notes are stored safely and reliably in a [Git repository](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) with full version history.
:::

## Features

### Sync with Git
Cerveau uses GitHub to store your Neuron notes. View and edit notes directly from your Git repo.

### Markdown editor
Edit Markdown with live preview. Link to notes by search. Optional Vim keybindings.

### Neuron + more
All of [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/)'s feature are supported: z-index, queries, themes, etc. Cerveau is built on top of the [open-source neuron](https://github.com/srid/neuron), and thereby will remain compatible with the later. Your neuron notes automatically work with Cerveau, and vice versa.

### Seamless Publishing
Publish your notes automatically on every change. 

Status: 
- For public repositories, publishing is supported via [neuron-template](https://github.com/srid/neuron-template).
- Publishing for private repositories is in roadmap.

### Collaborative editing
Collaborate on community zettelkastens, via tight integration with GitHub Pull Requests.

Status: to be done.
