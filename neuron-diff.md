# Differences from neuron

Cerveau uses neuron underneath and as such behaves the same as neuron. However, there are also some differences you should be aware of:

* **Raw HTML** is unsupported. For security reasons, Cerveau will show the raw HTML in your zettel file as-is, without rendering it.

See also <known-issues?cf> for some differences not listed here.
