# Known issues

These issues will eventually be addressed as Cerveau progresses through beta.

- MathJax will not render.
- Very large notes render slow
- Code syntax highlighting is disabled
- Tag links are disabled

## Git sync

If you had changed your repository outside of Cerveau, remember to 'sync' it in Cerveau the next time you come back to it. Auto-sync and better error messages will be supported in the near-future.
