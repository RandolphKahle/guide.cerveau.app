# Known issues

These issues will eventually be addressed as Cerveau progresses through beta.

- ~~[MathJax](https://neuron.zettel.page/2013701.html) rendering is disabled.~~ MathJax is now supported, and will be improved further once neuron [switches to KaTeX](https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/212#issuecomment-691231819).
- Tag links are disabled
- Images from static folder do not show up if the repo is private
- Very large notes render slow

## Git sync

If you had changed your repository outside of Cerveau, remember to 'sync' it in Cerveau the next time you come back to it. Auto-sync will be supported in the near-future.
